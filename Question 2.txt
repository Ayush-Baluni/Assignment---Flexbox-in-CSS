Q. Explain the role of the following key properties in the Flexbox layout model.
   1. justify-content
   2. align-items
   3. gap
   4. flex-direction
   5. flex-wrap


Ans.

1. justify-content:
-> justify-content is a CSS property that is used to align and distribute the flex items or content along the main axis of a flex container. It controls 
   the horizontal alignment of items within a flex container.
   There are several values that can be used with justify-content, like flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, etc.

2. align-items:
-> The align-items property in CSS is used to align flex items along the cross-axis within a flex container. It accepts values like flex-start, flex-end, 
   center, baseline, and stretch, controlling the vertical alignment of items in a flexbox. 
   Here are the possible values for align-items - stretch (default), 
   center, flex-start, flex-end, baseline, start, end, etc.

3. gap:
-> The gap property defines the size of the gap between the rows and between the columns in flexbox, grid or multi-column layout. It is a shorthand for the 
   following properties: row-gap, column-gap. Using just gap adds the gap to both, rows and columns.

4. flex-direction:
-> The flex-direction property is sub-property of flexible box layout module. It established the main axis of the flexible item. the main axis of the flex 
   item is the primary axis. Itâ€™s not necessarily horizontal all the time it basically depends on the flex-direction property. The flex property is useless 
   when the element is not flexible item.

5. flex-wrap:
-> The CSS flex-wrap property is used to specify whether flex items are forced into a single line or wrapped onto multiple lines. The flex-wrap property 
   allows enabling the control direction in which lines are stacked. It is used to designate a single line or multi-line format to flex items inside the 
   flex container.
